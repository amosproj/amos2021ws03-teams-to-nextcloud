Check out the documentation on our [GitHub Pages](https://amosproj.github.io/amos2021ws03-teams-to-nextcloud/).

# Product mission
Using the Teams to NextCloud plugin will provide the user with an alternative to the already built-in Sharepoint plugin for storing and managing data inside of Microsoft Teams. Users will be able to upload, download, modify data that is stored in NextCloud from inside of Teams as this is a core functionality of data management software. Additionaly, our plugin will enable the users to bind a shared folder to a specific channel, so that only the members of this channel will be able to see it and work on it.

## DEMO
  To see our app in action we have a [small Demo Video](Deliverables/sprint-12-demo-day-video.mkv)
  
## Running and developing
